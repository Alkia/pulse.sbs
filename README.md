# pulse.sbs
Pulse project repository


We added the SurveyJS PHP repository as a Git submodule, with the following command:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs-php.git survey
This command cloned the SurveyJS PHP repository into a folder named survey within the current project directory.
```
